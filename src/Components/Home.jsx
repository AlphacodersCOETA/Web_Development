          Declarative React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design
          simple views for each state in your application, and React will
          efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
          changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier
          to debug. Component-Based Build encapsulated components that manage
          their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since
          component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can
          easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
          Learn Once, Write Anywhere We don’t make assumptions about the rest of
          your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React
          without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server
          using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
